        Twinspire builds a living digital model of every athlete and
        patient —a real-time mirror of the body in motion
      </strong>
      <br /><br />
      By translating complex biosignals into intuitive metrics on 
      <strong>movement,</strong>
      <strong>muscle activity,</strong> and <strong>fatigue,</strong> our
      platform gives physiotherapists, coaches, and medical staff a
      unified, objective view of performance and recovery.
      <br /><br />
      With Twinspire, you can
      <strong>track every repetition, detect asymmetries</strong>
      <strong>early,</strong> and
      <strong>adjust workloads confidently</strong> — preventing injury
      before it happens and optimizing every step of rehabilitation.
